## Tech stack

Being an educational project I built it with the latest and greatest android technologies:

    - Jetpack Compose
      : for the project's UI
    - Retrofit
      : for all network requests
    - Dagger hilt
      : for dependency injection
    - Coroutines
      : for all async work


## Features

Why should you use this crypto application instead of any other in the market? Here's why:

    - All-encompassing list of coins and detailed information about each one.
      : Find information on any cryptocurrency ever made in seconds. From team and creation date to coin status, 
        find all relevant information about any coin
    - Secure yet free
      : The application is completely free and secure, which is something hard to come by. 
        No user data is collected at any stage of the user journey


## Support
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was an educational project, meant to practice what I'd learned

For any support report an issue on this repository, I'll work on it and update the codebase as soon as I can.

Better yet, you could fork the project and try fixing it, if it's something you think you can mend.
